# MAST Inputs & Files
Storage of various larger meshes/cases for MAST input.

We use this repository for storing large files used as example/test input such as input decks and meshes to keep them out of the [main MAST repository](https://github.com/MASTmultiphysics/mast-multiphysics).

If you are creating files that will be added to this repository, keep in mind that the largest individual file is restricted to <100MB by GitHub.
